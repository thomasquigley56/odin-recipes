This is the recipes project from The Odin Project Foundations course.
It is a website built using exclusively HTML to list some simple recipes.
After completing this project I will have demonstrated basic proficiency in HTML5, including the use of headers, lists, images, and links.
I will also have demonstrated basic proficiency in the use of git and github.
